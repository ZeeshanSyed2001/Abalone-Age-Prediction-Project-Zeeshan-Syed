# Abalone Age Prediction Project

## Abstract
The objective of the following assessment was to create a regression model intended to predict the ages of abalones using the features given. The dataset which was used was the Abalone dataset which had a number of features consisting of  length, diameter, weight, and the number of rings (a proxy for age). The target variable, Age, was calculated as Rings + 1.5.


With the aid of PyCaret, several regression models were trained and evaluated. Linear Regression was the model with the best performance which achieved perfect metrics that had a R2 score of 1.00 and nominal residual errors. As per the test results the Rings feature had the most impact on the predictor of age. Whilst on the contrary other features such as length and weight had limited impact.

In conclusion the following assessment automated machine learning frameworks were used in an effective manner in which it handled real world regression problems.
